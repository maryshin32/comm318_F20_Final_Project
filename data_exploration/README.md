# Data exploration notebooks for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

Greetings! Here I will introduce my data exploration on the files I collected. Below you can find a list of the notebooks in this folder, along with a short description of what I did in each one.


## Exploration notebooks: 

* `gtrends_cleaned` - I load in the data sets on Google Trends for each of my 5 words, then clean the rows, organize the columns and rename them, merge them together into one data frame, drop any columns I don't need, and put in the DateTime index. Then I make some initial observations before moving into data analysis in the next folder.

* `depression_cleaned` - I load in the data set from the source, make observations about this data, look through the columns and what the rows mean, organize and rename the columns, then make a data frame that matches my preferences and is easier to look through. After this cleaning, I make initial observations about the data which help me narrow down specific topics I want to focus on in the data analysis.

* `adverse_cleaned` - I read in the data set, look through the rows and columns, then clean and rename the columns. After this, I make brief initial observations and see if it's possible to move into data analysis and eventually include this factor in my data story.

* `cig_tob_use` - I read in the data set, make some initial observations about this data, then look at the different columns. I decide whether this data will help me in my analysis, and choose not to go further because the data does not include information about age groups, which is what I want to focus on going forward.

* `current_smokers_cleaned` - I load in the data, look at the rows and columns, make some observations, and clean and rename some of the columns. Then I move onto analysis in the next folder to look through whether this will help me characterize the depression trends I've found.

* `diabetes_cleaned` - I load in the data on prevalence of diabetes, look through the rows and columns, and rename them according to my preferences. I write down some important observations, make sure this data will allow me to analyze differences among age group, and then I use this cleaned data set in my 

* `physical_activity_cleaned` - I load in the data and explore what this data set means. After understanding what I'm working with, I rename columns and explore the data. I make some observations and move onto data analysis on these statistics in the next folder.

* `unemployment` - I read in the data set, make sure I understand what this information is telling me, and then I also make some initial observations about this data. Then I look at the different columns and see if there are interesting insights to learn. I decide whether this data will help me in my analysis, and choose not to go further because the data does not include any marked patterns that will help me characterize the depression trends. Thus, this data will not be included in the next folder on analysis.
