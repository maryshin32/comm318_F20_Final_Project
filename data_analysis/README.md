# Data analysis notebooks for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

Hello! I'm excited to guide you through this data_analysis folder! Here I will provide an overview of the series of Jupyter notebooks I created to do the data analysis.

The following list shows my analysis notebooks and brief descriptions on each one. For the sake of flow, please go through the analysis notebooks in the following order, as this will make the most sense for you! 

## Analysis notebooks:

* `gtrends_analysis` - In this notebook, I go through basic comparisons of search interest among the 5 data sets for Google Trends results, historical trends about the online interest, any noteworthy peaks in the data and the time frame for those peaks, any correlations between these Google trends with that of depression rates in CA. 

* `depression_analysis` - In the second analysis notebook, I inspect the data, make initial observations, analyze the historical trends of depression rates, look at which specific demographic categories I am working with and which ones to focus on, and also make key interpretations about depression among different sexes, age groups, etc. Eventually I narrow down my focus on differences among age groups, and this will lead me to the other analysis notebooks on factors potentially related the depression trends I find.

* `adverse_analysis` - In this notebook, I work to find interesting trends in how the reported rates of those with adverse childhood experiences have changed throughout the years, narrowly look into the differences among age groups, and discuss if this is another factor that I can account for in my data story that discusses mental health in CA.

* `current_smokers_analysis` - In this notebook, I go through yearly trends, comparisons in the proportion of current smokers across the different age groups, and see if the age groups match the ones from the Adult Depression data, which is my main data set. I discuss whether this will be a useful factor that I can include in my data story, then explain my next steps in data analysis.

* `diabetes_analysis` - In this notebook, I analyze historical trends, and again look at differences in the prevalence of diabetes among age groups, specifically paying attention to the 55-64 year-olds. I find patterns in diabetes as age increases, and decide how to include this in my data story.

* `physical_activity_analysis` - In this final notebook, I analyze yearly trends, and then yet again I look at specific differences across age groups in the number of individuals who met the Aerobic Physical Activity Guidelines. This provides me with more information about the 55-64 year age range and I can gauge whether this will be a useful factor to reference in my data story.
