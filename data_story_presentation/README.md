## Presentation of your data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

* This folder should contain the files that contain the output of all your data analysis. You can choose how you want to present your data story.


* Update this README file to describe the presentation.


In the story: PLOT- what context does the audience need, TWISTS- interesting things that you want the audience to notice, or compare?, ENDING- is there a CTA?
Incorporate important, engaging, useful/helpful data visualizations 
* Each visualization should support your overall story narrative
* 1-2 visualizations should do the job; make sure you're using preattentive attributes correctly and to your advantage! (lengths of bars maybe, or hue, or size)
* What do you want your audience to do?
