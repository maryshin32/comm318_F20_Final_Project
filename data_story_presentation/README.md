# My data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

Hello! You have arrived at the presentation of my data story. In this project I explored the following research questions: 

### What insights can we gain about mental health and wellness among different populations in California?
### What are some of the factors related to higher depression rates among certain age groups?

I have published my project as a data-driven article on Medium.com, and my target audience is broad, but in general can include anyone interested in mental health or psychology topics, health and wellness, the state of CA, demographic data analysis, or data science/visualization. I hope this can open up more conversations around older adults' experiences, and that we can feel more comfortable about giving space to important mental health issues.

In case there are any issues with accessing this Medium link, I have also uploaded my story as a PDF File in this folder.

Thank you very much for your time and attention, and I hope you enjoyed my Final Project!!! 

Cheers,
